      About NYC Open Data

NYC Open Data makes the wealth of public data generated by various New
York City agencies and other City organizations available for public
use. As part of an initiative to improve the accessibility,
transparency, and accountability of City government, this catalog offers
access to a repository of government-produced, machine-readable data sets.

Anyone can use these data sets to participate in and improve government
by conducting research and analysis or creating applications, thereby
gaining a better understanding of the services provided by City agencies
and improving the lives of citizens and the way in which government
serves them.

The data sets are available in a variety of machine-readable formats and
are refreshed when new data becomes available. Data is presented by
category, by City agency, or by other City organization. Descriptions of
the data, the collection method, and other contextual material, called
metadata, make the data sets easier to understand and use. Use of these
data sets and how they are generated can be better understood by reading
the Terms of Use <#>.


      How the City Uses Data to Create a Better City

The Mayorâ€™s Office of Data Analytics (MODA), the Department of
Information Technology and Telecommunications (DOITT), and NYC Digital
work together to collect, analyze, and share NYC Data, to create a
better City supported by data-based decision making, and to promote
public use of City data.

The City of New York is a national model for collecting data to measure
government performance. Agencies routinely collect data on buildings,
streets, infrastructure, businesses, and other entities within the City,
including permits, licenses, crime related data, and 311 complaints.
MODA centralizes City data, uniting previously disconnected pieces of
information from various agencies, and pairs it with NY state, federal,
and other open data to create a comprehensive City-wide data platform
that serves as a record of City activity, and a foundation for NYC Open
Data. DoITT and MODA work closely together to use that platform,
DataBridge, to reduce safety risk in the City, deliver daily services
more efficiently, and enforce laws more effectively.

The mission of NYC Digital
<http://www.nyc.gov/html/digital/html/home/home.shtml> is to realize New
York City's potential as the world's leading digital city, by creating
meaningful public-private partnerships that serve New Yorkers and
support economic development. NYC Digital produces the City's Digital
Roadmap, NYC's technology plan for access, education, open government,
engagement, and industry. In partnership with MODA, NYC Digital directs
Code Corps
<http://www.nyc.gov/html/digital/html/codecorps/codecorps.shtml>, the
nation's first municipal program that engages vetted volunteer
technologists to support City emergency and disaster recovery needs.
